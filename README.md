## alt-comm

This repository contains a note giving an
alternate decription of the commutator that leads 
easily to a polynomial time algorithm for computing it.

**Title**: The Commutator as Least Fixed Point of a Closure Operator
**Author**: William DeMeo
**Year**: 2017
**Abstract** We present a description of the (non-modular) commutator, inspired by that of
  Kearnes in [[1]][], that provides a simple recipe for computing
  the commutator.
